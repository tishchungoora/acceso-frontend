                    By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by
                    these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then

                  </p>
                  <h3>Links to other Websites</h3>

                  <p>
                    The Service may contain links to third-party web sites or
                    services that are not owned or controlled by Acceso.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Acceso has no control over, and assumes no responsibility

                  <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                  <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance
                    with the laws of United Kingdom, without regard to its
                    conflict of law provisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                    will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any
                    provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
                    unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
                    Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the
                    entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and
                    supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have
                    between us regarding the Service.

                  <h3>Changes</h3>
                  <p>
                    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or
                    replace these Terms at any time. What constitutes a Material
                    change will be determined at our sole discretion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By continuing to access or use our Service after those
                    revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the
                    revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please
                    stop using the Service.
